                            <p>Colorful Choices is one such program, which works to promote healthy decision making by students. Rather than focusing on metrics such as calories, fat grams, or weights, the program promotes a simpler way of eating healthier through opting for colorful fruits and vegetables. The program asks students to log their intake of fruits and vegetables for 20 days, while grouping them by color. Along with this, participants receive weekly emails featuring health tips and motivation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Last year, 489 students registered to participate in the program. Beyond individual accountability for logging daily intake of fruits and vegetables, these students were provided with resources for healthy recipes, tips on where to find fresh, local produce, and the opportunity to attend a cooking class.</p>
                            
                            <p>To calculate the success of the program, a participant survey was conducted with a 50% return rate. Of those who responded, 41.7% were eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day prior to participating. Following the program, those eating five or more servings a day jumped to 80.6%.</p>

                            <p>In addition, participants left many comments in the survey such as, “I liked that the suggestions were realistic for a college budget and time-frame. This program is conducive to the student lifestyle, and provides people with the information necessary to start making better nutritional choices one step at a time.” Another student remarked, “I like that it was easy to see how many fruits and vegetables you eat and the variety that you consume. I liked the follow up emails and the encouragement in them. I also appreciated the links to further info in those emails.” Due to this success, the program will continue to run during the 2012-2013 school year.</p>

                            <p>Beyond encouraging healthy dietary decisions, Student Health Service and Health Iowa, in collaboration with the University of Iowa Student Government and MopedU, promoted personal safety through the HeadStrong campaign implemented during the Spring 2012 semester. The goal of the campaign was to increase the number of student moped riders wearing helmets.</p>
                            
                            <p>Eleven Peer Agents identified as helmet-wearing moped riders were recruited to aid in spreading the word. These Peer Agents were given fifteen brochures about the campaign and vouchers for free helmets, a HeadStrong t-shirt, and talking points to encourage others to also wear a helmet. Peer Agents were then asked to approach friends and peers who ride mopeds without the protection of a helmet. If these friends or peers signed a pledge card to wear a helmet, they received a voucher to redeem a free helmet from MopedU. 150 helmets were purchased for this purpose.</p>

                            <p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ast year, the University of Iowa Housing Department was faced with a challenge: their housing placement system needed to be replaced. The answer came in the form of Star Rez; a system that helps manage student housing applications, allowing students to choose from several preferences during the process. The system matches roommates based factors such as ideal study environment within the room or allowable noise level. 50% of incoming freshmen (around 2,200) opted for the roommate matching feature during its first year of operation.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>“Star Rez allows us to have dynamic applications that allow students self-select rooms, LLCs, meal plans, and even the new shop & swap program,  where students can advertise their room or swap roommates.”</p>

                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Outcomes of the new process are promising. RAs are reporting fewer roommate disputes on their floors and fewer roommate changes when compared with the previous years. Before Star Rez, roommates were paired based on the building and room type requested. Star Rez promises to be even more useful next year, when all incoming students will be required to choose a Living Learning Community during their first year in the Residence Halls.</p>
