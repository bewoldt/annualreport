                        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Women’s Resource and Action Center (WRAC) held its fifth Iowa N.E.W. Leadership Summer Institute in May, 2011. The five-day intensive institute inspires women to participate in creating awareness for underrepresented groups in all sectors of public leadership. Approximately 35 women from colleges and universities across Iowa attended the conference last year. Their experience at the institute was built around a challenging curriculum that developed knowledge and skill in key areas such as strategic communication,  policy analysis, philanthropy, negotiation, community development, professional sustainability, relationship-building, engagement, conflict, and collaboration.</p>
                        <p>In the Institute's fifth year, WRAC made notable improvements to the program. Linda Kroon, Director for WRAC, says that she noticed a significant difference in the women in the program throughout the course of the Institute.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“As the week goes on, you really start to see the women flex their skills. You can tell these women are gaining confidence in themselves.”</p>
                            <small>Linda Kroon</small>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Through the Iowa N.E.W. Leadership Institute, WRAC is assisting the development of relationships among women in the Iowa City community. The skills learned through this program are crucial in the support of helping other women develop their personal goals.</p>
                        <p>A new component implemented last year is the mentorship portion. While at the Institute, the students are assigned to professionals to help guide them through the process. Students are matched based on their interests. They work on building experience by connecting to women who are leaders in their desired fields. Once the students complete the workshop, they are qualified to become a professional mentor.</p>
                        <p>Iowa N.E.W. Leadership has given students new skills that have helped them gain executive roles in student organizations on campus. The program has also helped UI graduates start and maintain great careers post-graduation.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“N.E.W. Leadership gave me confidence in my ability to lead. Not only for future political positions, but the current leadership posts I have and am striving for my career. It created a real desire to know more about the world and to help change it.”</p>

New social and living situations, academic challenges, and newly found independence can take up every minute of every day. Pick One is an initiative that encourages students to get involved in at least one organization early on. Being involved in student organizations or activities can be a valuable experiential learning experience.</p>
                            <p>There are nine areas students can choose from: Academic/Honors Opportunities, Campus Employment, Fraternities and Sororities, Intramural or Club Sports, Leadership, Multicultural Activities, Performing Arts, Student Organizations, and Volunteering. There are more than 450 student organizations through the Center for Student Involvement and Leadership, and these organizations are the most popular choices by students using Pick One. Close followers are fraternities and sororities, intramural sports, and student employment. The most popular Pick One opportunity is Dance Marathon, but Hawks Nest and intramural football are close seconds.</p>
