                <h1>Find your Pick One!</h1>
                <p>Stats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>42% of students did Pick One last year</li>
                    <li>9 different broad categories to choose an opportunity from</li>
                    <li>Most popular Pick One - Dance Marathon</li>
                    <li>Over 450 Student Organizations on campus</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Pick One is an initiative for first year students to get involved on campus. There are nine areas students can choose from: Academic/Honors Opportunities, Campus Employment, Fraternities and Sororities, Intramural or Club Sports, Leadership, Multicultural Activities, Performing Arts, Student Organizations, and Volunteering. But don’t let that limit you to just one opportunity! The most popular categories are student organizations (there are over 450 on campus!). Close followers are Fraternities and Sororities, Intramural Sports, and Student Employment. The most popular specific Pick One opportunity is Dance Marathon, but HawksNest and Intramural Football/Flag Football also have a lot of student involvement.</p>

                <p>Pick One is in its 5th year of operation and sees continuous growth and engagement each year. This year, Pick One had a participation rate of more than 42% of all first-year students.</p>

                <p>Why should you participate? Pick One gives students the chance to feel more connected on campus while having fun and meeting people. Involvement helps build your resume with teamwork and leadership skills. Getting involved makes people feel more connected to their campus, and increases retention for the University. By simply registering your Pick One on the exploration tool at http://pickone.uiowa.edu, you will be eligible to win great prizes, including an iPad. Pick One started as a catalyst to get students involved, but there are so many other things people can do on campus. In the future, the Pick One program may expand to include transfer students.</p>

                <h1>WRAC: Building Up the Young Girls Network</h1>
                <p>The Women’s Resource and Action Center (WRAC) held it’s fifth Iowa N.E.W. Leadership Summer Institute from May 21 -25 last academic year. The 5-day intensive institute inspires women to participate in creating awareness for underrepresented groups in all sectors of public leadership. Approximately 35 women from colleges and universities across Iowa were selected to attend the conference this year. Their experience at the institute is built around a challenging curriculum that develops knowledge and skill in key areas such as strategic communication, policy analysis, philanthropy, negotiation, community development, professional sustainability, relationship-building, productive engagement with difference, conflict, and collaboration.</p>

                <p>In the Institutes fifth year, WRAC has made notable improvements to the program. Director at WRAC, Linda Kroon, says that she notices a significant difference in the women in the program throughout the course of the week.</p>

                <p>“As the week goes on, you really start to see the women flex their skills,” Kroon said. “You can tell these women are gaining confidence in themselves.”</p>

                <p>Through Iowa N.E.W., WRAC is assisting the development of relationships among women in the Iowa City community. The skills learned through this program are crucial in the support of helping other women develop their personal goals.</p>

                <p>A new component implemented this year is the mentorship portion. While at the Institute, the students are assigned to professionals to help guide them through the process. Students are matched based on their interests (TO WHAT?). They work on building experience by connecting to women who are leaders in their desired fields. Once the students complete the workshop, they are qualified to become a professional mentor.</p>

                <p>Now in its fifth year, the Iowa N.E.W. Leadership Institute’s alumni group is growing. Kroon says she likes to say the Institute is building up the young girls network. One Iowa N.E.W. alumnus described her experience.</p>

                <p>“N.E.W. Leadership gave me confidence in my ability to lead.” SAID WHO? “ Not only for future political positions, but the current leadership posts I have and am striving for my career. It created a real desire to know more about the world and to help change it.” </p>

                <p>After participating in the Institute’s workshop, participants had a new sense of leadership and ambition in the community. Students have qualified and held executive board positions in student organizations on campus, along with acquiring reputable jobs across the nation.</p>
