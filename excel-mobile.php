                        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of Iowa encourages and inspires diversity campus-wide through many initiatives. The Change Teams are an initiative by the Division of Student Life’s Multicultural Work Group that are responsible for developing, implementing, and ensuring an inclusive environment for all students on campus. The Change Teams are organized by the Iowa Memorial Union Committee co-chaired by Roy Salcedo, Coordinator for Multicultural Programs, and Patricia Kruse, Associate Director of IMU administration and operations. The overall intention of the program is to increase awareness and acceptance of diverse populations of the campus.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“Our hope is that we will impact students and staff on a daily basis, if only in the way we all think about acceptance.”</p>
                            <small>Patricia Kruse</small>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The teams work to raise this acceptance by creating a division wide effort to raise awareness across the campus based upon the daily interactions the team has with students. The Iowa Memorial committee meet every other week for an hour to discuss how the campus is currently and review how others are doing both within the University of Iowa and other institutions. They take that information and apply it to practical usage that they delegate among the committee. The change teams are currently in the planning stage, building a series of goals to accomplish over the upcoming years.</p>
                        <p>Among these projects include creating a new vision for the Iowa Memorial Union. This involves creating a logo and a web page for the purpose of sharing with students the diversity, opportunities for culturally diverse student organizations, and cultural events on campus. The web page will also be a tool for staff because it provides surveys and training for better inclusiveness on campus. The change teams seek to create change not just by these means, but through ways that are always evolving.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“We hope to affect change through questioning, learning, and listening.”</p>

Student supervisors in IOWA GROW™ help students make the connection between what they learn in their classes to what they are learning at their place of employment. This connection is key to the overall professional and academic success of our students. IOWA GROW™ uses four essential questions to keep their long term goals in sight:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How is this job fitting in with your academics?</li>
                                <li>What are you learning here that’s helping you in school?</li>
                                <li>What are you learning in class that you can apply here at work?</li>
                                <li>Can you give me a couple of examples of things you’ve learned  here that you think you’ll use in your chosen profession?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These questions reinforce “Every Student, Every Encounter” through the personal relationships student supervisors are making with their employees. This connection is crucial to student academic success through their campus employment.</p>

                            <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic school year, the University of Iowa, in conjunction with Student Disability Services (SDS), the ITS staff, and the Iowa Center for Assistive Technology Education and Research (ICATER), purchased a site license of Read and Write Gold 10. Read and Write Gold is assistive technology that provides access to required readings for students with “print disabilities” such as learning disabilities, ADHD, chronic health disabilities, and mobility impairments.</p>

                            <p>The purchase of Read and Write Gold is a further commitment to making the University of Iowa’s campus, classes, and college experience more accessible for students with and without disabilities. It would cost an individual $650, but is free for all registered students to use on computer labs and is available as a free download for personal computers. The tool has helped students with reading, writing, studying and researching. The beauty of Read and Write Gold is that it is a valuable tool for all students and its use doesn’t come with a stigma of using “special” software.</p>

                            <p>This new technology is helping students with disabilities excel academically. The program features virtual highlighters, fact folders, spell check, definitions of words and phrases, and several reading and writing tools. With nearly 60% of student disabilities not registered, SDS was looking for a tool to provide assistance for all students at the university.</p>

                            <p>While Read and Write Gold is helping students with disabilities improve their academic work, it has also helped students without disabilities excel. When reading a document, students can use the virtual highlighters that allow users to highlight important information which will then collect into a personal study guide. Fact folders allow students to collect and gather facts while doing research papers. Once the fact folders are created, Read and Write Gold will automatically create a bibliography for the gathered information. There is an MP3 creator tool that turns text into an MP3 file that students can listen to on the go.</p>

                            <p>Student Disabilities Services also plays a role in the use and distribution of Read and Write Gold. They offer Alternative Media Services, where students can get class materials, and textbooks made more accessible. There is also Alternative Test Services, where students can take tests in a format that is most convenient for them. The student workers in Student Disability Services help about 200 students each year.</p>

                            <p>According to the University Counseling Services (UCS), the education students gain during their time at the University of Iowa is a 4-year experience that is both academic and nonacademic. The education they build through these experiences coalesce and contribute to their overall development. Student development is built on a base of the mindfulness they have in any situation that they may face. The UCS offers Mindfulness programming to students in various group courses ranging from outside of the classroom to for-credit courses available through the university.</p>

                            <p>“Students learn formal mindfulness meditation practices that include awareness of physical, cognitive and emotional experiences, as well as informal practices such as mindful eating, studying, communication, and mindful use of cellphones and social media,” Kerri Eness-Potter, Program Coordinator for MIndfulness-Based Programs, said. “They are also introduced to research and application to professional and academic areas.”</p>

                            <p>In the 2011-2012 academic year, UCs offered two non-academic courses titled “Mindfulness Foundations” and “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All.” Both of these classes contained eight-week group sessions that differ in scope. The “Mindfulness Foundations” course focused upon teaching students the secular, personal practices of mindfulness. It also focused upon the conceptual and theoretical aspects of mindfulness and the academic importance of mindfulness when looking at research and other resources. The course, “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All” is a course that is meant for first-year students to help them transition from prior life to university life by teaching them the skills they can use in relation to personal stresses internally and externally.</p>

                            <p>“The focus is not on learning to relax but to actually engage with what is here, even when it isn’t relaxing, in a conscious and discerning manner, Eness-Potter said. “This means learning how to be with difficult thoughts and emotions as well as external stressors.”</p>

                            <p>Between 15-20 students attended each section of the two courses. In the for-credit courses, students are achieving high scores. The student evaluations conducted at the closing of each course have come back very positive. Although the program has been at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics since 1996, the mindfulness courses started in 2009. It is still in the pilot research phase, but the effect that it has had on students is evident.</p>

                            <p>“Students do quite well in the for credit classes, though most comment that they are more work than what they expected!” Eness-Potter said. “The relevance of the material to their daily life, and the positive changes they see seem to keep them motivated to do the work.”</p>

                            <p>In the last year, University Counseling Service has extended their reach to students by establishing a Facebook page and twitter accounts. With this outreach, along with classes offered, students can reach their potential at the UI and find their path in life.</p>
