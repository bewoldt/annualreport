Rather than having backpacks filled with textbooks and crumpled notes, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity carried stones inscribed with the names of women who have fallen victim to breast cancer. The stones were part of a breast cancer awareness walk, one of many philanthropic events organized by fraternities and sororities in 2011. In the last year, the UI fraternity and sorority community has contributed over 22,000 hours of community service and donated a total of $382,000 to various organizations.</p>

                            <p>UI fraternities and sororities donate their time to as many as 12 community and philanthropic organizations ranging from the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation to Habitat for Humanity. Rather than focusing on just one cause, the students in the greek community strive to help those in need from all walks of life. This support not only generates monetary donations, it also serves to increase awareness.</p>
                            <p>One effort, carried out by the women of Zeta Tau Alpha, included distributing “Think Pink” breast cancer ribbons at several UI football games last year. This effort was followed up by their annual 5K race in October. The ribbons are a visual reminder of the cause, while the 5K race is a direct fundraising effort. These multi-faceted campaigns helps press community members to do more than simply write a check. It’s a way for the community to unite. In 2011, the race raised over $17,500 from participants and donors.</p>

                            <p>What makes the Fraternities and Sororities on campus so successful is the passion they have for helping others. This passion is evident in the effort that goes into their philanthropic events. They do not simply put on a race or donate money to charities, but they create an atmosphere for giving in businesses around Iowa City. At the annual 5K race, food was donated from restaurants around town, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheba Hut, and Panera. Their desire to make a difference is contagious, and so by creating a united front with others, the Fraternities and Sororities of the University of Iowa help bring the world one step closer to finding the cure for breast cancer, aid children fighting for their lives, and provide homes to families in need.</p>

Students can join student organizations and help with their philanthropic efforts or volunteer their time at various community centers that need help. One of the ways the residence halls look to get students started out in volunteering is through their Saturdays in Service program.</p>

                            <p>This program was created by the National Residence Hall Honors (NRHH) as one of the ways to fulfill one of their founding pillars &mdash; service. Saturdays in Service is a monthly volunteer opportunity for students living in the residence halls. There is no long-term commitment and the volunteer opportunities change every month. “[It is] a good way for students to get a better taste of what service opportunities are available, and hopefully spark some interest for them,” said Amy Baumgartner, the Residence Life Program Coordinator.</p>

                            <p>This year, Saturdays in Service kicked off with an event that provided a choice of six different opportunities students could choose from. They included the Children’s Museum, river cleanup, Witty Kitties (an animal sanctuary), Potentially Yours (a thrift store), the Johnson County Crisis Center, and the Ronald McDonald House. All of the locations are easy to get to or had transportation provided and lasted about half a day.</p>

                            <p>Last year, the volunteering at Witty Kitties, a local animal sanctuary, was the most popular program. Many students missed their pets from back home, so volunteering at the sanctuary was a good way for students to get in bonding time animals while helping out a good cause.</p>

                            <p>Approximately 25 students volunteer at each Saturdays in Service event. Students are the backbone of the program; they choose the activities, generate excitement among peers, and have passion to work hard to help others. Kristi Roehr, a previous volunteer, said, “It’s a fun and easy way to get involved, meet new people, and help out the community.”</p>
