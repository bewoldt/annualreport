Dance Marathon, an annual charity,  is only one of many that Fraternity and Sorority Life contributes to each year. As a whole, the group donates their time and resources to the Child’s Miracle Network, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the American Heart Association, Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, Make a Wish Foundation, Crisis Center of Iowa City, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, American Cancer Society, Ronald McDonald Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Mark Twain Elementary of Iowa City, and Dance Marathon. In 2011, the Fraternity/Sorority Community contributed to over 22,000 hours of community service and donated over $382,000 to their various organizations.</p>

                                <p>In the Fall of 2011, the Fraternity and Sorority Life hosted their annual United Way 5K on Sunday, October 16th, to begin Homecoming week. This 3.1 mile race took place at Lower City Park to help raise awareness and funds for the United Way of Johnson County. The foundation unifies the Iowa City community to give, advocate, and volunteer to positively impact the conditions of Iowa City and measurably improve lives. All proceeds from the race benefited the United Way of Johnson County.</p>
                                <p>Every year the women of Zeta Tau Alpha come together to raise money for our breast cancer awareness philanthropy. To raise money we hold our annual 5K races every October, in 2011 we raised over $17,500. Before the day of the race we do a lot of marketing throughout the community. We start by handing out our “Think Pink” breast cancer ribbons at several University of Iowa football games. We see this as a great way of spreading the word about breast cancer awareness to a wider variety of people. In addition to the “Think Pink” we set up community fund raising nights at local restaurants.  This has worked very well for us, and we also see it as a significant way to get involved in the fight against breast cancer. Another big benefactor in our race has been the Greek Community. Every year (all) of the chapters on campus have come out to support our philanthropy, and we cannot thank them enough.</p>

                                <p>Last year in particular, Phi Kappa Psi had members of their fraternity walk with backpacks on filled with 100 stones that each way 1 pound, with names of women who have, or have had, breast cancer. Zeta Tau Alpha, and many other people, saw this as one of the most genuine, caring, things, to do to support breast cancer awareness. The weeks before the race, and getting people involved is what makes our philanthropy very successful, but we also do a lot the day of the race. On the day of the race we have a silent auction, a raffle, prizes, awards for runners, free massages and a live DJ. When the race is finished we have a table full of food for the runners, we have had donations from places such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheba Hut, and Panera.</p>

                                <p>We see this as a great way to give back to the people who have come out to support breast cancer awareness, and to let them know how much we appreciate them. Without them we would not be able to raise the amount of money we have in the past, for a cause that Zeta Tau Alpha feels so passionately about. Our race this year falls on October 21, 2012. Last year we had nearly 700 runners, and we want to make this year even better. If anybody would like to donate to our philanthropy you can email Kayla Dano at <a href="mailto:kayla-dano@uiowa.edu">kayla-dano@uiowa</a>.edu or Stephanie Kleeman at  <a href="mailto:stephanie-kleeman@uiowa.edu">Stephanie-kleeman@uiowa.edu</a>, and if you want to sign up for the 5K you can go to our website</p>

Students miss their pets from back home, so it was a good way for students to get in some animal time while helping out a good cause. (pull quote)</p>

                                <p>Did you know that Iowa City is the number one city in Iowa and the number three city in the nation for volunteer involvement, according to an article in the Press-Citizen?</p>

                                <p>National Residence Hall Honors (NRHH) is an organization that students at the University of Iowa can get involved with through their residence hall. The four pillars of NRHH are Service, Leadership, Recognition, and Academics. As part of their Service pillar, NRHH created a program called Saturdays in Service. Saturdays in Service is a monthly volunteer opportunity for students living in the residence halls. There is no long-term commitment and the volunteer opportunities change every month. </p>

                                <p>This year, Saturdays in Service kicked off with an event that provided a choice of six different locations and opportunities students could choose from. Opportunities include the Children’s Museum, river clean-up, Witty Kitties (an animal sanctuary), Potentially Yours (a thrift store), Johnson County Crisis Center and Ronald McDonald House. All of the locations are easy to get to or have transportation provided and last about half a day. Last year, the most popular opportunity was volunteering at the animal sanctuary, Witty Kitties. Many students missed their pets from back home, so volunteering at the sanctuary was a good way for students to get in some animal bonding time while helping out a good cause.</p>

                                <p>Generally, about 20-25 students participate each Saturday. Students are the backbone of Saturdays in Service. They pick the activities that people can participate in, generate excitement among their peers, are very passionate and work really hard.</p>

                                <p>Is Saturdays in Service not exactly what you’re looking for? That’s ok. Find your passion. Get involved with 1-2 things, but don’t overcommit. Whatever you choose to do, make an impact and leave your mark on the University of Iowa campus.</p>
