                        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>The Meet the Challenge Awards are given to those who are examples of successes coming to life at the University of Iowa. When students take their first steps on campus they are not simply inducted into an academic community that strives towards higher education, but they become apart of the Hawkeye family. Cassidy Bell, a 2012 graduate, won the Meet the Challenge award for Engage in the last year for her work at the Rape Victim Advocacy Program (RVAP) where she had been volunteering since June 2011. By recognizing students such as Bell with the Meet the Challenge awards, it allows students to act as visible examples to inspire future students in the paths that they take on in their 4-year stay at the University of Iowa.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“It is a thrill and honor to be recognized for the work that I do. I certainly feel like I am engaged in the community,” Bell said. “Iowa City has become my home in the last several years and I am proud to be on both the giving and receiving side of support in this community.”</p>
                            <small>Cassidy Bell</small>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The Meet the Challenge Awards are broken down by each of the five initiatives by the Iowa Challenge. Five awards are given each year with a $500 award to each recipient for the awards: Excel, Stretch, Choose, Engage, Serve.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                        	<p>“In a sense, it helps provide a roadmap that students can use to achieve success at Iowa and beyond,” said Sarah Hansen, Director of Assessment and Strategic Initiatives at the Division of Student Life.</p>

                        </blockquote>

                        	<p>For Bell, it was an unexpected honor to receive this award because she had not heard of the Meet the Challenge awards before. Her work was for her own pleasure of serving the community rather than being something with an end goal. “I was honored as soon as [I was] notified of my nomination, but even more so after seeing how prestigious the Iowa Challenge is,” Bell said.</p>

                        <p>Volunteering with RVAP was something that Bell desired to do to compliment her work in the classroom as a psychology major. Her plans after graduation are to have a therapy practice. She felt that volunteering would have the benefit of serving the Iowa City community as well as learning something new. Working there was something she could feel a sense of pride about.</p>

                        <p>“I thought this would be a good way to help people, get experience in the field and
                        find out if a career in counseling is actually something that I want to do,” Bell said.</p>

                        <p>Volunteering for RVAP was one of the many things that Bell was apart of on campus. Other student organizations and groups that she has had a hand in during her 4-year stay at the UI include Simply Food, the Local Foods Connection, and the Iowa City Farmers Market.</p>

                        <p>The awards have distinguished students among their peers as not just a way to recognize the unique abilities of students, but to encourage others. These five awards for the expectations of the Iowa Challenge set the standard for what excellence is and what all students should strive to do at the University of Iowa and beyond. </p>

                        <p>“We hope that seeing the amazing things our Meet the Challenge winners are doing will inspire all students to use the challenge as a guide for their own path to success,” Hansen said.</p>

                        <p>Bell graduated with a degree in Psychology and a minor in Health Promotion in 2012. She has continued engaging with the Iowa City community by working as the Family Service Specialist at the Local Foods Connection as well as the manage the Iowa City Farmers Market. </p>

                        <p>Other award winners for the 2011-2012 academic year include Rachel Kentor (Excel Award), Kotheid Nicoue (Stretch Award), Jason Heard (Choose Award), and Ben Phol (Serve Award). </p>

Student supervisors in IOWA GROW™ help students make the connection between what they learn in their classes to what they are learning at their place of employment. This connection is key to the overall professional and academic success of our students. IOWA GROW™ uses four essential questions to keep their long term goals in sight:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How is this job fitting in with your academics?</li>
                                <li>What are you learning here that’s helping you in school?</li>
                                <li>What are you learning in class that you can apply here at work?</li>
                                <li>Can you give me a couple of examples of things you’ve learned  here that you think you’ll use in your chosen profession?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These questions reinforce “Every Student, Every Encounter” through the personal relationships student supervisors are making with their employees. This connection is crucial to student academic success through their campus employment.</p>

The education they build through these experiences coalesce and contribute to their overall development. Student development is built on a base of the mindfulness they have in any situation that they may face. The UCS offers Mindfulness programming to students in various group courses ranging from outside of the classroom to for-credit courses available through the university.</p>
                    
                            <p>“Students learn formal mindfulness meditation practices that include awareness of physical, cognitive and emotional experiences, as well as informal practices such as mindful eating, studying, communication, and mindful use of cellphones and social media,” Kerri Eness-Potter, Program Coordinator for MIndfulness-Based Programs, said. “They are also introduced to research and application to professional and academic areas.”</p>

                            <p>In the 2011-2012 academic year, UCs offered two non-academic courses titled “Mindfulness Foundations” and “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All.” Both of these classes contained eight-week group sessions that differ in scope. The “Mindfulness Foundations” course focused upon teaching students the secular, personal practices of mindfulness. It also focused upon the conceptual and theoretical aspects of mindfulness and the academic importance of mindfulness when looking at research and other resources. The course, “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All” is a course that is meant for first-year students to help them transition from prior life to university life by teaching them the skills they can use in relation to personal stresses internally and externally.</p>

The student evaluations conducted at the closing of each course have come back very positive. Although the program has been at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics since 1996, the mindfulness courses started in 2009. It is still in the pilot research phase, but the effect that it has had on students is evident.</p>
                            <p>“Students do quite well in the for credit classes, though most comment that they are more work than what they expected!” Eness-Potter said.</p>
                            <p>In the last year, University Counseling Service has extended their reach to students by establishing a Facebook page and twitter accounts. With this outreach, along with classes offered, students can reach their potential at the UI and find their path in life.</p>

                            <p>This new technology is helping students with disabilities excel academically. The program features virtual highlighters, fact folders, spell check, definitions of words and phrases, and several reading and writing tools. With nearly 60% of student disabilities not registered, SDS was looking for a tool to provide assistance for all students at the university.</p>

                            <p>While Read and Write Gold is helping students with disabilities improve their academic work, it has also helped students without disabilities excel. When reading a document, students can use the virtual highlighters that allow users to highlight important information which will then collect into a personal study guide. Fact folders allow students to collect and gather facts while doing research papers. Once the fact folders are created, Read and Write Gold will automatically create a bibliography for the gathered information. There is an MP3 creator tool that turns text into an MP3 file that students can listen to on the go.</p>

                            <p>Student Disability Services also plays a role in the use and distribution of Read and Write Gold. They offer Alternative Media Services, where students can get class materials, and textbooks made more accessible. Alternative Test Services is another program from SDS, allowing students to take exams in a format that is most accessible for them. The student employees in Student Disability Services assist approximately 200 students each year.</p>
