Cassidy Bell, a 2012 graduate, won the "Engage" award for her work at the Rape Victim Advocacy Program (RVAP), where she had been volunteering since June 2011.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“It is a thrill and honor to be recognized for the work that I do. I certainly feel like I am engaged in the community. Iowa City has become my home in the last several years and I am proud to be on both the giving and receiving side of support in this community.”</p>
                            <small>Cassidy Bell</small>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Five Meet the Challenge Awards are given each year with a $500 award to recipient in the following IOWA Challenge areas: Excel, Stretch, Choose, Engage, Serve.</p>
                    	<p>“In a sense, The IOWA Challenge helps provide a roadmap that students can use to achieve success at Iowa and beyond,” said Sarah Hansen, Assistant Vice President for Student Life Assessment and Strategic Initiatives.</p>
                        <p>For Bell, the award was an unexpected honor, and she had not heard of the Meet the Challenge Awards before being nominated. “I was honored as soon as [I was] notified of my nomination, but even more so after seeing how prestigious the Iowa Challenge is,” Bell said. “I thought this would be a good way to help people, get experience in the field and find out if a career in counseling is actually something that I want to do."</p>
                        <p>Volunteering with RVAP also complemented Bell's work in the classroom as a psychology major. Her plans after graduation are to have a therapy practice. She felt that volunteering would have the benefit of serving the Iowa City community as well as learning something new. Working at RVAP was something she could feel a sense of pride about. Other student organizations and groups that Cassidy has had a hand in during her 4-year stay at the UI include Simply Food, the Local Foods Connection, and the Iowa City Farmers Market.</p>

                        <p>“I thought this would be a good way to help people, get experience in the field and
                        find out if a career in counseling is actually something that I want to do,” Bell said.</p>

                        <p>Volunteering for RVAP was one of the many things that Bell was apart of on campus. Other student organizations and groups that she has had a hand in during her 4-year stay at the UI include Simply Food, the Local Foods Connection, and the Iowa City Farmers Market.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“We hope that seeing the amazing things our Meet the Challenge winners are doing will inspire all students to use the challenge as a guide for their own path to success.”</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Bell graduated with a degree in Psychology and a minor in Health Promotion in 2012. She has continued engaging with the Iowa City community by working as the Family Service Specialist at the Local Foods Connection and serving as manager for the Iowa City Farmers Market.</p>

                        <p>Other award winners for the 2011-2012 academic year include Rachel Kentor (Excel Award), Kotheid Nicoue (Stretch Award), Jason Heard (Choose Award), and Ben Pohl (Serve Award).</p>

Supervisors in IOWA GROW™ help students make meaningful connections between their student jobs and academic pursuits. IOWA GROW™ uses four essential questions to keep their long-term goals in sight:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How is this job fitting in with your academics?</li>

                                <li>What are you learning in class that you can apply here at work?</li>
                                <li>Can you give me a couple of examples of things you’ve learned  here that you think you’ll use in your chosen profession?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These conversations help students discover connections between work and academics, leading to a deeper understanding of future career paths, professional environments, and how to apply what they learn in the classroom.</p>

Mindfulness practice helps students learn to face challenging situations, manage stress, and increase focus. The UCS offers Mindfulness programming to students in various group courses ranging from outside of the classroom to for-credit courses available through the university.</p>
                    
                            <p>“Students learn formal mindfulness meditation practices that include awareness of physical, cognitive and emotional experiences, as well as informal practices such as mindful eating, studying, communication, and mindful use of cellphones and social media,” Kerri Eness-Potter, Program Coordinator for MIndfulness-Based Programs, said. “They are also introduced to research and application to professional and academic areas.”</p>

                            <p>In the 2011-2012 academic year, UCS offered two non-academic courses titled “Mindfulness Foundations” and “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All.” Both of these classes contained eight-week group sessions that differ in scope. The “Mindfulness Foundations” course focused upon teaching students the secular, personal practices of mindfulness. It also focused upon the conceptual and theoretical aspects of mindfulness and the academic importance of mindfulness when looking at research and other resources. “Mindfulness: Being Here With It All” is meant for first-year students to help them transition to university life by teaching them skills they can use in relation to personal stresses.</p>

                            <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic school year, the University of Iowa, in conjunction with Student Disability Services (SDS), the ITS staff, and the Iowa Center for Assistive Technology Education and Research (ICATER), purchased a site license of Read and Write Gold 10. Read and Write Gold is assistive technology that provides access to required readings for students with "print disabilities" such as learning disabilities, ADHD, chronic health disabilities, and mobility impairments.</p>

                            <p>The purchase of Read and Write Gold is a further commitment to making the University of Iowa’s campus, classes, and college experience more accessible for students with and without disabilities. It would cost an individual $650, but is free for all registered students to use on computer labs and is available as a free download for personal computers. The tool has helped students with reading, writing, studying and researching.</p>
                            <p>This new technology is helping students with disabilities excel academically. The program features virtual highlighters, fact folders, spell check, definitions of words and phrases, and several reading and writing tools. With nearly 60% of student disabilities not registered, SDS was looking for a tool to provide assistance for all students at the university.</p>

                        <div class="span6">
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>The beauty of Read and Write Gold is that it is a valuable tool for all students and its use doesn’t come with a stigma of using “special” software.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>While Read and Write Gold is helping students with disabilities improve their academic work, it has also helped students without disabilities excel. When reading a document, students can use the virtual highlighters that allow users to highlight important information which will then collect into a personal study guide. Fact folders allow students to collect and gather facts while doing research papers. Once the fact folders are created, Read and Write Gold will automatically create a bibliography for the gathered information. There is an MP3 creator tool that turns text into an MP3 file that students can listen to on the go.</p>

                            <p>Student Disability Services also plays a role in the use and distribution of Read and Write Gold. They offer Alternative Media Services, where students can get class materials, and textbooks made more accessible. Alternative Test Services is another program from SDS, allowing students to take exams in a format that is most accessible for them.
