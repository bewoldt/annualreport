                                <p>The University of Iowa Cultural and Resource Centers (UICRC) on campus are a resource for student on campus to support underrepresented groups on campus and provide empowerment and opportunities to make connections on campus. The UICRC do not only do this, but create a learning environment for students who are not necessarily affiliated with these groups, but want to get to know other cultures on campus. Within this, students can find allies on campus, understand how the university works, and get to know different people on campus ranging from students to faculty.</p>
                                <p>“It develops and fosters relationships that are often lost on such a large campus,” Preston Keith, the manager of the Lesbian Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Resource Center, said. “It is pretty much a home away from home for each and every student to feel comfortable and safe.”</p>

In the last year, the UICRC has been successful in starting new initiatives and creating new staff changes. This culminates in more attention to center relationships while still recognizing newly created student groups, constituency groups, and community members.</p>

                            <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of Iowa encourages and inspires diversity campus-wide through many initiatives. The Change Teams are an initiative by the Division of Student Life’s Multicultural Work Group that are responsible for developing, implementing, and ensuring an inclusive environment for all students on campus. The Change Teams are organized by the Iowa Memorial Union Committee co-chaired by Roy Salcedo, Coordinator for Multicultural Programs, and Patricia Kruse, Associate Director of IMU administration and operations. The overall intention of the program is to increase awareness and acceptance of diverse populations of the campus.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>“Our hope is that we will impact students and staff on a daily basis, if only in the way we all think about acceptance.”</p>

                            </blockquote>
                            <p>The teams work to raise this acceptance by creating a division wide effort to raise awareness across the campus based upon the daily interactions the team has with students. The Iowa Memorial committee meet every other week for an hour to discuss how the campus is currently and review how others are doing both within the University of Iowa and other institutions. They take that information and apply it to practical usage that they delegate among the committee. The change teams are currently in the planning stage, building a series of goals to accomplish over the upcoming years.</p>
                            <p>Among these projects include creating a new vision for the Iowa Memorial Union. This involves creating a logo and a web page for the purpose of sharing with students the diversity, opportunities for culturally diverse student organizations, and cultural events on campus. The web page will also be a tool for staff because it provides surveys and training for better inclusiveness on campus. The change teams seek to create change not just by these means, but through ways that are always evolving.</p>

                                <p>Walk It Out (WIO) held their third annual multicultural fashion show on April 7, 2012, showcasing an array of fashions from diverse cultures across the globe. With over 1,000 people in attendance, fifteen student organizations collaborated to celebrate cultural diversity on the University of Iowa campus. This year, University Hospitals and Clinics HIV/AIDS Program also participated in the fashion show to increase awareness and promote education of HIV and AIDS on campus. Hip-Hop, East Asian, LGBTQ, South Asian, Middle Eastern, African, and Latin American cultures and regions were represented in the show.</p>
                                <p>Student President of the Walk It Out Fashion Show, Evan Ivory, said this year’s show has been the best one yet. The 2012 fashion show improved significantly compared to previous years.</p>
                                <p>In terms of quality, the music transitions, the clothing the models wore, and even the containment of the 100+ models backstage, every aspect showed improvement from the year before.</p>
                               <p>“Most importantly, this year’s show had participants interact more with one another while educating them on unfamiliar topics at the same time,” Ivory said.</p>

                                <p>The faces of WIO also promoted diversity by demonstrating that a cultured group of students can work and grow together to achieve excellence and higher education, all while enjoying themselves. The fashion show pushed their participants to actively seek out ways to meet people who are different from them. Furthermore, participating in the Walk It Out fashion show allowed several students the opportunity to step outside their comfort zone and participate in a character altering event.</p>
