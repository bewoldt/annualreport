In the last year, the UICRC has been successful in starting new initiatives and creating new staff changes. This culminates in more attention to center relationships while still recognizing newly created student groups, constituency groups, and community members.</p>
                           <p>From 2011 to 2012, there was a 10.5% increase in visitrs to the Centers, with the Asian Pacific American Cultural Center (APACC) receiving the largest percentage of increase in visits (39%). During the 2011-2012 school year, the Centers saw a total of 28,769 visitors. </p>

During the 11-12 academic year, each department within the Division appointed a small workgroup, or change team, charged with developing plans to ensure an inclusive environment for all students on campus. The IMU Change Team is co-chaired by Roy Salcedo, Coordinator for Multicultural Programs, and Patricia Kruse, Associate Director of IMU Administration & Operations. The purpose of the program is to increase awareness and acceptance of diverse populations of the campus.</p>

                            <p>“Our hope is that we will impact students and staff on a daily basis, if only in the way we all think about acceptance.”</p>

                        <p>Through daily interactions, staff training, changes to job requirements, and a communications effort, the Change Teams are hoping to curate an atmosphere of inclusion. The IMU Change Team meets bi-weekly for an hour to discuss the climate on campus and within the building, then decide on actions that can improve specific issues or situations.</p>

                        <p>Some of the work in progress includes adding inclusionary language to position descriptions, vision statements, and other planning documents. Additionally, the group has dedicated a display case in the IMU to multicultural and diversity-related groups. A website has been created at the Division and the IMU level to reflect multicultural efforts. The sites will list upcoming training opportunities and reflect other efforts. The Change Team is always looking for new ways to create and support an inclusionary environment on campus.</p>

With over 1,000 people in attendance, fifteen student organizations collaborated to celebrate cultural diversity on the University of Iowa campus. This year, University Hospitals and Clinics HIV/AIDS Program also participated in the fashion show to increase awareness and promote education of HIV and AIDS on campus. Hip-Hop, East Asian, LGBTQ, South Asian, Middle Eastern, African, and Latin American cultures and regions were represented in the show.</p>
                            <p>Student President of the Walk It Out Fashion Show, Evan Ivory, said this year’s show has been the best one yet. The 2012 fashion show improved significantly compared to previous years.</p>
                            <p>In terms of quality, the music transitions, the clothing the models wore, and even the containment of the 100+ models backstage, every aspect showed improvement from the year before.</p>
                           <p>“Most importantly, this year’s show had participants interact more with one another while educating them on unfamiliar topics at the same time,” Ivory said.</p>
